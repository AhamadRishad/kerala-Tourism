              Ernakulam is the central business district of the city of Kochi,
              Kerala, India. It is the namesake of Ernakulam district. The
              eastern part of Kochi city is mainly known as Ernakulam, while the
              western part of it after the Venduruthy Bridge is called as
              Western Kochi. Many major establishments, including the Kerala
              High Court, the office of the Kochi Municipal Corporation and the
              Cochin Shipyard are situated in Ernakulam. It is also the most
              urbanized area in the city of Kochi. <br />
              The region can claim to have played a significant part in
              fostering the trade relations between Kerala and the outside world
              in the ancient and medieval period. The early political history of
              Ernakulam is interlinked with that of the Chera Dynasty of the
              Sangam age, who ruled over vast portions of Kerala and Tamil Nadu.
              After the Cheras, the place was later ruled by the Kingdom of
              Cochin (Perumpadapu Swaroopam).

              Marine Drive, also known as APJ Abdul Kalam Marg,is a famous
              promenade in Kochi, India. It is built facing the backwaters, and

              populace. Despite its name, no vehicles are allowed on the
              walkway. Marine Drive is also an economically thriving part of the
              city of Kochi. With several shopping malls it is as an important
              centre of shopping activity in Kochi. Major fast food joints,
              including Marrybrown, DiMark, Coffee Bar are present along the
              walkway. <br />

              The view of the setting and rising sun over the sea mouth, and the
              gentle breeze from the Vembanad Lake has made Marine Drive an
              important tourist destination in Kochi. Hundreds of people (both
              natives, and tourists) throng the walkway during the evenings. The
              walkway starts from the High Court Junction and continues until
              the Rajendra Maidan. There are also several boat jetties along the
              walkway.[5] The walkway has three bridges: the Rainbow bridge, the
              Chinese Fishing Net Bridge and the House Boat Bridge.

                      The port at Kozhikode held superior economic and political
                      position in medieval Kerala coast, while Kannur, Kollam,
                      and Kochi, were commercially important secondary ports,
                      where the traders from various parts of the world would
                      gather.[4] Fort Kochi was a fishing village in the Kingdom
                      of Kochi in the pre-colonial Kerala. The Portuguese
                      arrived at Kappad Kozhikode in 1498 during the Age of
                      Discovery, thus opening a direct sea route from Europe to
                      India. The territory that would be later known as Fort
                      Kochi was granted to the Portuguese in 1503 by the Rajah
                      of Kochi, after the forces of Afonso de Albuquerque helped
                      him fighting the forces of Saamoothiri of Kozhikode. The
                      Rajah also gave them permission to build Fort Emmanuel
                      near the waterfront to protect their commercial interests.
                      The first part of the name Fort Kochi comes from this
                      fort, which the Dutch later destroyed. The Portuguese
                      built their settlement behind the fort, including a wooden
                      church, which was rebuilt in 1516 as a permanent
                      structure, today known as the St Francis Church. Fort
                      Kochi remained in Portuguese possession for 160 years. In
                      1683 the Dutch captured the territory from the Portuguese,
                      destroyed many Portuguese institutions, particularly
                      Catholic including convents. The Dutch held Fort Kochi in
                      their possession for 112 years until 1795, when the
                      British took control by defeating the Dutch. Foreign
                      control of Fort Kochi ended in 1947 with the Indian
                      independence. <br />

                      Dutch and British in these colonial periods line the
                      streets of Fort Kochi. St Francis Church was built in 1503
                      by the Portuguese as a Catholic church. Vasco da Gama was
                      once buried in this church which now falls under the
                      Church of South India and is one of the national
                      monuments. Catholic Diocese of Cochin was erected under
                      Portuguese Padroado in 1558 with its headquarters in Fort
                      Kochi. Santa Cruz Basilica, also built by the Portuguese
                      in the 16th century, was later destroyed by the British
                      and rebuilt near the end of 19th century. From this period
                      there are other residential buildings and hotels such as
                      the Old Harbour House, some of which have been renovated
                      in more recent times. The landmark that causes more public
                      and visitor interest is a series of precolonial Chinese
                      fishing nets on the waterfront, believed to have been
                      introduced by Chinese traders in the early 14th century.

              at the Thattekkad Bird Sanctuary. His famous survey of Travancore
              in the 1930s led to the formation of this modern day paradise for
              avian life. He noted that the area was rich in bird diversity and
              ought to be turned into a sanctuary to conserve the same. The over
              300 species that reside in these tropical and deciduous forests
              are testament to his great vision. One can run across the Sri
