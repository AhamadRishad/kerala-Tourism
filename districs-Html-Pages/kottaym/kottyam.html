            <p class="lead  fs-6 fw-normal">
                Illikkal Kallu is a Thalanadu located on top of the Illickal Malaa 
                in the Kottayam district of Kerala, India.The distance from kottayam
                 railway station to illikal kallu is 57km. Situated at around 3500 
                 feet above sea level, Illickal Kallu is a major tourist attraction 
                 in Thalanadu. L. S. G.D., Thalanadu village of Meenachil taluk. 
                 Only one half of the original rock remains, as the other half
                  of the rock has fallen off. The nearest town is Teekoy. 
                  Numerous mountain streams originate from this peak and 
                  flow down to form the Meenachil River. Tourists must trek 1
                   km to reach the summit of the peak. <br> Illikkal Mala 
                   comprises three hills, each rising up to 4,000 ft above 
                   sea level. Each of the hills has a peculiar shape. One
                    of them resembles a mushroom, which is why it is known 
                    as Kuda Kallu (umbrella-shaped rock). The second hill has 
                    a small hunch on the sides and is therefore referred to as
                     Koonu Kallu (hunch back rock). There is a 1/2-foot-wide bridge 
                     called Narakapalam (bridge to hell) connecting these two hills.
                      The beauty and the landscape of illikkal kallu is similar to 
                      that of the pillar rocks in Kodaikanal. It is said that the 
                      mythical medicinal herb Neela Koduveli grows here.

            <p class="lead  fs-6 fw-normal">
                Vagamon (Malayalam: വാഗമൺ) is an Indian hill station and a revenue 
                village primarily located in Peerumedu Taluk of Idukki district 
                (majority area including Vagamon town), and also
                 Meenachil taluk and Kanjirappally taluk of Kottayam 
                 district in the state of Kerala, India.Located in the
                  Western Ghats 25 kilometres (16 mi) east of Erathupetta on 
                  the border of Kottayam-Idukki districts, Vagamon is famous
                   for its natural beauty. The Vagamon glass bridge is 
                   the longest cantilever glass bridge in India.
                   <br> Vagamon remained unexplored for centuries. Though
                    the British had plantations here, it was only in 1926,
                     when Walter Duncan and Company started their tea 
                     plantations, that it became well-known. In the 1930s, 
                     more tea plantations were set up in the area. After
                      1940, people from Travancore, and people from Madras
                      (Tamil Nadu), migrated to Vagamon. Later, after the 
                      formation of Kerala State, people from various parts 
                      of Kerala migrated there.[citation needed] <br>

                   In 1955, the Trappist monastery Kurisumala Ashram was founded in Vagamon

                Thazhathangady Juma Masjid is a mosque situated in Thazhathangady, 
                one of the Heritage Zones of Kerala, India, near the town of Kottayam,
                 and on the banks of the Meenachil river. It is one of the oldest 
                 mosques in India, dating back more than 1000 years. This mosque
                  is known for its beautiful architecture as well as its craftsmanship,
                   including intricate wooden carvings, a secret passageway, and a 
                   water tank carved out of a single block of stone.Its southern 
                   half was demolished and extended with iron pillars, aluminum 
                   sheets and minars in 2012. <br>

                   Thazhathangady Juma Masjid is also called as the "Taj Juma Masjid".
                    The ancestors of this Masjid came and settled in Kottayam,
                     from different parts of Kerala. The Muslims who lived here
                      played an active role in Freedom Struggle and other National
                       Movements. <br>

                   Since 2019, Thazhathangady Juma Masjid in Kerala's Kotayam has 
                   opened its doors for women devotees. "Muslim women in the right 
                   attire can enter the mosque only on the two days, April 24 and
                    May 8, as decided by the committee," said Moulavi Sirajjuddeen
                     Hasni, the chief imam.
