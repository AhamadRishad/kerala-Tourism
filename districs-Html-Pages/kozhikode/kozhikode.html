            <p class="lead fs-6 fw-normal">Kozhikode also known in English as Calicut, is a city along the Malabar 
                Coast in the state of Kerala in India. It has a corporation limit population of
                 609,224[8] and a metropolitan population of more than 2 million, making it the 
                 second largest metropolitan area in Kerala and the 19th largest in India.[11]
                  Kozhikode is classified as a Tier 2 city by the Government of India.[12] <br>

                It is the largest city in the region known as the Malabar and was the capital of 
                the British-era Malabar district. In antiquity and the medieval period, Kozhikode
                 was dubbed the City of Spices for its role as the major trading point for Indian 
                 spices.[1] It was the capital of an independent kingdom ruled by the Samoothiris
                  (Zamorins). The port at Kozhikode acted as the gateway to medieval South Indian 
                  coast for the Chinese, the Persians, the Arabs and finally the Europeans.[13]
                   According to data compiled by economics research firm Indicus Analytics in 2009
                    on residences, earnings and investments, Kozhikode was ranked the second-best
                     city in India to live in.[14] In November 2023, Kozhikode became the first Indian 
                     city to be included in the list of Creative Cities Network (UCCN) by UNESCO.

                 in the 1980s, Mavoor Road became the centre of attraction. In 2010s, 
                 Thondayad Bypass area and Palazhi on the Airport road has emerged as 
                 the new city centre with a vibrant night life. <br>

                Mishkal Mosque 
            </h1>
            <p class="lead  fs-6 fw-normal">
                Mishkal Mosque (Malayalam: മിശ്കാൽ പള്ളി, also spelled Mithqal Mosque[1]) is a 
                medieval mosque located in Calicut on Malabar Coast, southern India. The mosque, 
                one of the few surviving medieval mosques in Kerala, is regarded as an important 
                cultural, historical and architectural monument of Kerala. <br>

                The mosque was built by the eponymous Muslim merchant-shipowner 
                (nakhuda) in the 14th century.[2][1] Mishkal - active in Calicut in the 1340s -
                 possessed "great wealth" and a fleet of ships for "the trade with India, China,
                  Yemen, and Persia".[3] Ship-owners known as the nakhudas were among the wealthiest 
                  merchants of medieval Indian Ocean world.[3] <br>
                
                Mishkal Mosque is located in Kuttichira neighbourhood, a part of Thekkepuram beach
                 in Calicut. <br>
                
                
                Another view of the mosque ,
                In January 1510,the mosque was partially burned in a Portuguese attack on Calicut by 
                Albuquerque which also occupied the Zamorin's palace.The attack was later repulsed by 
                the Zamorin's Nair troops with 300 to 500 Portuguese killed and the remaining barely 
                even surviving.[4] The top floors of the mosque still display some of that damage.[2][5]

                            The shattered mosque was later renovated and refurbished under Zamorin's supervision.
                            He used to offer land and grant permission for the Muslims to construct worship places
                             or mosques wherever intended. The Muchundi Mosque in Kuttichira till date holds
                              inscriptions on stone that shows his financial contribution towards its construction 
                              in the thirteenth century. <br>
                           
                           Mishkal Mosque originally had five stories. It was rebuilt in 1578/79[1] after
                            the 1510 arson and now has four stories.[2] Typical for similar medieval mosques
                             in Kerala, it has no cupolas and minarets and heavily employs timber.

                           A large tank known as the Kuttichira tank is attached to the mosque. The mosque has 
                           47 doors, 24 carved pillars and a big prayer hall that can accommodate around 400 people. 
                           The prayer hall is well ventilated and there is a wooden member with intricate motifs.
