            <p class="lead fs-6 fw-normal">Idukki  is one of the 14 districts in the Indian state
                 of Kerala. It is the largest district in Kerala and lies amid the Cardamom 
                 Hills of Western Ghats in Kerala. Idukki district contains two municipal towns -
                  Kattappana and Thodupuzha, and five taluks. <br>

                The district was constituted on 26 January 1972, by taking Peerumade, Udumbanchola,
                 Devikulam taluks of the former High Range division from Kottayam district and the 
                 Thodupuzha taluk from Ernakulam district. Its division was previously 
                 headquartered at Kottayam city, but moved to Kuyilimala near Painavu and 
                 Cheruthoni in June 1976. Malayalam and English are the two official administrative 
                 languages in the district. Tamil is the second most spoken language in idukki
                  district after Malayalam. <br>
                
                Around 66% of Kerala's power needs come from various Hydroelectric Power Projects in
                 Idukki district. Numerous cash crops and spices are cultivated throughout the
                  district, making it The Spice Garden of Kerala. A significant area in the 
                  district is protected as reserved forests and wildlife sanctuaries. The
                   Periyar River is a major river that originates and flows through Idukki.
                    The Pamba River is another important river that originates from Idukki 
                    district.

            <p class="lead  fs-6 fw-normal">
                The Idukki Dam is a double curvature arch dam constructed across the Periyar 
                River in a narrow gorge between two granite hills locally known as Kuravan and
                 Kurathi in Idukki, Kerala, India. At 168.91 metres (554.2 ft), it is
                  one of the highest arch dams in Asia. It is constructed and owned by 
                  the Kerala State Electricity Board. It supports a 780 MW hydroelectric power
                   station in Moolamattom, which started generating power on 4 October 1975.
                    The dam type is a concrete, double curvature parabolic, thin arc dam.
                     The Indo-Canadian project was inaugurated by the Prime Minister Indira 
                     Gandhi on February 17, 1976. <br>

                   This dam was constructed along with two other dams at Cheruthoni and Kulamavu. 
                   Together, the three dams and Two saddle dams, Kulamavu Saddle Dam (Near Junction)
                    and Kulamavu Saddle Dam (Right Bank) have created an artificial lake that is 
                    60 km2 (23 sq mi) in area. The stored water is used to produce electricity at 
                    the Moolamattom Power house, which is located inside nearby rocky caves. <br>
                
                    Narakakkanam, Azhutha, Vazhikkadavu, Vadakkepuzha and Kuttiar diversion schemes 
                    were later added to augment the Idukki reservoir .

                 in its wild sanctuaries and forests aroma of spice scented cool air yes! This beautiful
                  destination has all these and more. It's the place you would love to visit it's the
                   place you would wish never to leave. Munnar is such a beautiful place in Kerala, 
                   which cannot be portrayed in a single canvas. Everything and anything here will
                    make us excited. The hills, the mist, the valleys, the streams, the waterfalls,
                     tea plantations, rare flora and fauna.... It is a beautiful tea town in Idukki 
                     district of Kerala easily accessible from Kochi and Coimbatore. The gorgeous hill

                      around 557 sq km, Munnar in Devikulam Taluk is the largest panchayat in Kerala.
                       Munnar got its name from its strategic location at the confluence of three rivers
                     - Muthirapuzha, Nallathanni and Kundala Rivers. 'Moonu' means 'three' and 'Aru'
                      means 'river'. The region is placed at a height of around 1,500 m to 2,695 m 
                      above sea level and was once the summer capital of the British in South India. 
                      Later it was developed for cultivating tea plants. The beautiful sights of acres 
                      and acres of lush green tea plantations will make us realize that we have at last
                       reached Munnar and of course the place is so much known for its tea estates. It 
                       always carries the remnants of history of tea cultivation in Kerala. Neelakurinji
                        or Strobilanthus has special status in the tourism map of this fascinating
                         destination. The flower which blooms once in twelve years attracts lots of 
                         tourists from all over the world.
