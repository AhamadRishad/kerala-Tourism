            <p class="lead fs-6 fw-normal">Kollam also known by its former name Quilon  is an ancient seaport and 
                city on the Malabar Coast of India bordering the Laccadive Sea, which is a part of the Arabian Sea.
                 It is 71 km (44 mi) north of the state capital Thiruvananthapuram. The city is on the banks of
                  Ashtamudi Lake and the Kallada river.] Kollam is the fourth largest city in Kerala and 
                  is known for cashew processing and coir manufacturing. It is the southern gateway to the Backwaters of Kerala
                   and is a prominent tourist destination. Kollam is one of the most historic cities with continuous
                    settlements in India.Geographically, Quilon formation seen around coastal cliffs of Ashtamudi 
                    Lake, represent sediments laid down in the Kerala basin that existed during Mio-Pliocene times. <br>

                Kollam has a strong commercial reputation since ancient times. The Arabs, Phoenicians, 
                Chinese, Ethiopians, Syrians, Jews, Chaldeans and Romans have all engaged in trade at 
                the port of Kollam for millennia. As a result of Chinese trade, Kollam was mentioned by 
                Ibn Battuta in the 14th century as one of the five Indian ports he had seen during the 
                course of his twenty-four-year travels.

                The world's largest bird sculpture and within it a rock theme park 
                for adventure enthusiasts is what today pays tribute to the mythical bird
                 from the Indian epic Ramayana - Jatayu. Legend has it that Jatayu tried 
                 to save Sita (wife of Lord Rama) when Ravana, a demon king, was abducting
                  her in his airborne chariot. Jatayu is said to have fought valiantly and 
                  fallen on these rocks, grievously injured. The Jatayu Adventure Center 
                  (Jatayu Earth's Center), at Chadayamangalam, 50 km from Thiruvananthapuram,
                   is a unique combination of artistry, mythology, technology, culture, adventure, 
                   leisure, and wellness. The virtual reality museum and the theatrical magic 
                   that renders the story of Jatayu add to the magic of the destination. 
                   A creation of Mr. Rajiv Anchal, this destination is sure to leave each 
                   visitor awestruck. The state of the art ropeway offers one a bird's eye view of God
                   's Own Country just as the helicopter rides do as well. <br>
 
                 The Jatayu Adventure Center offers the largest adventure park within a natural 
                 terrain. Paintball, valley crossing, bouldering, zip line, trekking, archery,
                  rappelling, jumaring and wall climbing are among the myriad activities available here.
                   The climbing activities are designed around the natural rock formations on the hillside.

                  thirty percent of the historic Kollam town is encompassed by the placid Ashtamudi
                   Lake. Kollam has been Kerala leading cities in the olden times. It was a
                    leading trade capital of the old world from the era of the Phoenicians
                     and Ancient Rome. The backwaters of Ashtamudi is acomplex labyrinth.
                      It is the second largest and deepest wetland ecosystem. The name 'Ashtamudi'is
                       adapted from the topography of the lake.'Ashta' means eight and 'mudi' means coned
                       . The beautiful lake gets its name Ashtamudi, because of its 8 arms or channels. 
                       The scenicwater body is the gateway to the backwaters. The labyrinthine network 
                       comprise myriad brackish lagoons, lakes, canals, rivers and inlets. The serene
                        backwater stretch of Ashtamudi Lake is embraced by clusters of palm and coconut <br>
                        
                        trees. Typical quaint villages of Kerala dot the banks of the lake. The blessed 
                        ambiance is an inspiring muse. Writers, painters and observers are left in awe of 
                        the beauty. The nurturing waters of Ashtamudi is them their source of livelihood
                         for the villages. Fishing and coconut husking are two of the popular here.
