            <p class="lead fs-6 fw-normal">Palakkad also known as Palghat, historically known
                 as Palakkattussery, is a city and municipality in the Indian state of Kerala.
                  It is the administrative headquarters of the Palakkad District. Palakkad is 
                  most densely populated municipality and fourth-most densely populated city 
                  in Kerala. It was established before Indian independence under British rule
                   and known by the name Palghat. Palakkad is famous for the ancient Palakkad
                    Fort, which is in the heart of the city and was captured and rebuilt by Hyder
                     Ali in 1766. The city is about 347 kilometres (216 mi) northeast of the 
                     state capital, Thiruvananthapuram. <br>

                The 18th-century Palakkad Fort has sturdy battlements, a moat, and a Hanuman 
                temple on its grounds. North on the Kalpathy River, the 15th-century Viswanatha
                 Swamy Temple is the main venue of the Ratholsavam chariot festival. The river
                  Bharathappuzha flows through Palakkad. Palakkad is on the northern bank 
                  of Bharathappuzha River. <br>
                
                Palakkad was included in the South Malabar region of Malabar District during 
                the British Raj. The municipality of Palakkad was formed on 1 November 1866 
                according to the Madras Act 10 of 1865 (Amendment of the Improvements in 
                Towns act 1850) of the British Indian Empire, along with the municipalities
                 of Kozhikode, Kannur, Thalassery, and Fort Kochi, making them Kerala's oldest
                  modern municipalities.

            <p class="lead  fs-6 fw-normal">
                From the town of Nenmara in Palakkad district, the cloud-caressed peaks
                 of the majestic Nelliyampathy Hill ranges are a sight to behold. The height 
                 of the hills ranges from approximately 467 m to 1572 m and it has an extremely 
                 calming effect on all who view it. To reach Nelliyampathy, one has to take the
                  road starting from Nenmara that proceeds to the Pothundy Dam. There are about 
                  10 hairpin bends that have to be negotiated on the way to Nelliyampathy. The 
                  Pothundy Dam is a beautiful locale with facilities for boating and is a nice
                   option as a picnic place. As the Ghat road winds its way up to Nelliyampathy,
                    at certain places there are viewpoints from where the vast stretches of Palakkad 
                    district are visible with its extensive paddy fields forming a verdant carpet. 
                    It also offers a splendid view of the Palakkad Gap, which is a geographical 
                    phenomenon in the Western Ghats formation in this region, bringing into view,
                     parts of the adjoining State of Tamil Nadu. On the way up, those interested 
                     in bio farming can take a close look at the privately managed farms and also 
                     vast expanses of tea estates managed by different plantation companies. The
                      hills of Nelliyampathy are also well known for its orange cultivation.
