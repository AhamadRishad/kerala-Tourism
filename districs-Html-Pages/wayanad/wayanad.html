            <p class="lead fs-6 fw-normal">Wayanad is a district in the north-east of the Indian state 
                of Kerala, with administrative headquarters at the municipality of Kalpetta. It is the 
                only plateau in Kerala.[7] The Wayanad Plateau forms a continuation of the Mysore
                 Plateau, the southern portion of Deccan Plateau which links the Western Ghats with 
                 the Eastern Ghats. It is set high in the Western Ghats with altitudes ranging from 
                 700 to 2100 meters.[8] Vellari Mala, a 2,240 m (7,349 ft) high peak situated on the
                  trijunction of Wayanad, Malappuram, and Kozhikode districts, is the highest point
                   in Wayanad district. The district was formed on 1 November 1980 as the 12th district 
                   in Kerala, by carving out areas from Kozhikode and Kannur districts. An area of 
                   885.92 km2 of the district is forested.[9] Wayanad has three municipal 
                   towns—Kalpetta, Mananthavady and Sulthan Bathery. There are many indigenous tribes 
                   in this area.[10][11] The Kabini River, a tributary of Kaveri River, originates at
                    Wayanad. Wayanad district, along with the Chaliyar valley in neighbouring Nilambur
                     (Eastern Eranad region) in Malappuram district, is known for natural gold fields,
                     [12] which are also seen in other parts of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. Chaliyar
                      river, which is the fourth longest river of Kerala, originates on the Wayanad
                       plateau. The historically important Edakkal Caves are located in Wayanad district.

                The Edakkal caves are two natural caves at a remote location at Edakkal,
                 25 km (15.5 mi) from Kalpetta in the Wayanad district of Kerala in India.
                  They lie 1,200 m (3,900 ft) above sea level on Ambukutty Mala, near an
                   ancient trade route connecting the high mountains of Mysore to the ports
                    of the Malabar Coast. Inside the caves are pictorial writings believed 
                    to date to at least 6,000 BCE,[1][2] from the Neolithic man, indicating
                     the presence of a prehistoric settlement in this region.[3] The Stone 
                     Age carvings of Edakkal are rare and are the only known examples from 
                     South India besides those of Shenthurini, Kollam, also in Kerala.[4] 
                     The cave paintings of Shenthurini (Shendurney) forests in Kerala are 
                     of the Mesolithic era (middle stone-age).

                            (6,000+ km2), including all of the sanctuary, is under consideration by the World 
                            Heritage Committee for selection as a World Heritage Site.[2] <br>
                              It is part of the Deccan Plateau and the vegetation is predominantly of the south
                              Indian moist deciduous teak forests. Also, the sanctuary has pastures of the
                               west-coast semi-evergreen trees. The wildlife sanctuary comes under Protect 
                               Elephant and one can spot herd of elephants roaming in the area. Elephant rides
                                are arranged by the Kerala Forest Department. <br>
  
                              Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary was formed in 1973 and was brought under 
                              the Project Elephant in 1991 92. This sanctuary occupies an area of
                               345 km2. It is the second largest one in the state of Kerala. 
                               The sanctuary is separated into two disconnected parts known as 
                               the North Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary and South Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary. 
                               The area in between the two parts was originally a forest region, 
                               though it is now occupied majorly by plantations.[citation needed] <br>
  
                              In 2012, a tiger was shot dead by the Kerala Forest Department on a 
                              coffee plantation on the fringes of the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary. 
                              Many local political leaders applauded the killing of the tiger. Chief 
                              Wildlife Warden of Kerala ordered the hunt for the animal after mass
                              protests erupted as the tiger had been carrying away domestic animals.[4]

                Drives to Wayanad are full of many memorable vantage points that offerone 
                mesmerising views of the valley below. The Neelimala viewpoint is easily among
                the upper echelon in the district. Here, one gets a pristine view of the great
                 Meenmutti Waterfalls,causing people to throng to this destination in large numbers. <br>

                The trek up to the viewpoint is just as beautiful as the destination itself. You are 
                surrounded by plants and flowers of all varieties and hues along, with the refreshing 
                aroma of coffee giving you company the entire way. Small birds chirp merrily and urge 
                you to the summit. Soon the setting changes and the mighty Western Ghats appear at their
                 finest. The clouds seem closer and the valley appears to extend indefinitely from 
                 this point. From the mist covered slopes to the massive boulders in interesting 
                 formations around you, you get to choose whichever slice of nature you wish to explore.

                   Kerala, India.[1] It is a three-tiered waterfall with a height of 300 metres.[2] 
                   Meenmutty is a combination of Malayalam words Meen (fish) and Mutty (blocked).
                    It can be accessed from Mananthavady - Kuttiady road .[3] [4] Meenmutty waterfalls
                     are dangerous during rainy seasons due to high inflow and many people have
                      drowned since 1991.[5] Meenmutty falls is surrounded by Lush green tea 
                      plantations making the hike to the falls a memorable experience to the tourists.

              <p class="lead  fs-6 fw-normal">
                Banasura Sagar Dam, which impounds the Karamanathodu tributary of the Kabini 
                River, is part of the Indian Banasurasagar Project consisting of a dam and a 
                canal project started in 1979.[1] The goal of the project is to support the 
                Kakkayam Hydro electric power project and satisfy the demand for irrigation
                 and drinking water in a region known to have water shortages in seasonal 
                 dry periods. The dam is also known as Kuttiyadi Augmentation Main Earthen 
                 Dam. The dam has a height of 38.5 metres (126 ft) and length of 685 metres 
                 (2,247 ft). <br>

                In the dam's reservoir there is a set of islands that were formed when the 
                reservoir submerged the surrounding areas.[2] The islands with the Banasura
                 hills are in the background view.[3] It is the largest earth dam in India 
                 and the second largest of its kind in Asia. The dam is made up of massive 
                 stacks of stones and boulders.[4]
