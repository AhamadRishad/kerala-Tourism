            <p class="lead fs-6 fw-normal">Thiruvananthapuram, built on seven hills, has
                 today growninto a sprawling metropolis; but thankfully the city still retains 
                 her past glory and charm, and in spite of the frenetic pace of modern life,
                  perhaps it is the most sedate of the big cities of the State. The people too
                   have retained their friendliness and hospitality, and communicating in
                    English, Hindi or Tamil is as easy as it is in the native Malayalam, 
                    whether one is talking to a retired professor or to the man in the street.
                     But be prepared for a 'dose' of highly individualistic observations though- a
                      hallmark of the Malayali that has enabled him to adapt and to survive the
                       Tsunamis of alien cultures and ideas, and all things 'modern'. The old
                        quarter of the city clusters in and around the East Fort, a protected
                         landmark that dates back to the Royal days. The rightly famous Sri
                          Padmanabhaswamy temple , the Navarathri Mandapam, where the annual 
                          musical fest is held as an offering to Saraswati, the Goddess of
                           Learning , Kuthira Malika, a uniquely wonderful example of traditional 
                           architecture and the venue of the annual Swathi Thirunal music festival
                            honouring the composer-king of Travancore are the best among 
                            the traditional structures that adorn the Fort enclave. The Mahatma 
                            Gandhi Road, the chief artery of the city, is lined by traditional 
                            mansions that proclaim the grandeur of the times past and modern
                             high-rises that testify to the city's newfound affluence
                              and a brashly commercial taste -red tile and timber vying
                               with concrete and glass.

                Padmanabhaswamy Temple
               
            </h1>
            <p class="lead  fs-6 fw-normal">
                Located inside the East Fort in Thiruvananthapuram, the capital city of 
                the State of Kerala in India is the Sree Padmanabha Swamy Temple dedicated 
                to Lord Vishnu. This temple is a blend of the Kerala and Dravidian styles 
                of architecture. It is believed to be the world's richest temple.
                 The history of Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple dates back to 8th century.
                  It is one of the 108 sacred Vishnu temples or Divya Desams in India.
                   Divya Desams are the holiest abodes of Lord Vishnu that are mentioned
                    in the works of the Tamil Azhvars (saints). The presiding deity of
                     this temple is Lord Vishnu, reclining on Anantha, the hooded Serpent
                     . Marthanda Varma, noted among Travancore kings, did a majo
                     r renovation to the temple and it resulted in the present day 
                     structure of the Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple. It was Marthanda <br>
                     
                     Varma who introduced the Murajapam and Bhadra Deepam festivals
                      in the temple. Murajapam, which literally means continuous chanting 
                      of prayers, is still conducted in the temple once every six years.  <br>
                      
                      In 1750, Marthanda Varma dedicated the kingdom of Travancore to 
                      Lord Padmanabha. Marthanda Varma vowed that the royal family will
                       rule the State on behalf of the Lord and he and his descendants 
                       would serve the kingdom as Padmanabha Dasa or the Servant of Lord 
                       Padmanabha. Since then the name of every Travancore King was
                        preceded by the title Padmanabha Dasa. The donation of the 
                        kingdom of Travancore to Padmanabhaswamy was known as
                         Thripadidanam.

                Locals in the capital city of Thiruvananthapuram will declare that a weekend drive
                 to Ponmudi is among the best ways to spend time in the city. Families and friends
                 alike are known to go on long drives up the winding paths for a view they insist
                  rivals any other in the State. The slopes shrouded in mist fill one with a
                   feeling of wonder and amazement. A large amount of rare flora and fauna
                    can be seen here including mountain flowers, wild orchids and exotic
                     butterflies. The temperature is equable throughout the year and the 
                     three hour drive from the city is justified once the valley comes into 
                     view. One can always stopover at the breath-taking Kallar River on the way,
                      which flows parallel to the road in the opposite direction, with the 
                      picturesque Meenmutty Waterfalls only a little distance ahead. A large
                       number of cottages and resorts have come up in the area. The tree house
                        view tower is another great place to visit. Ponmudi is indeed a rising 
                        hotbed of tourist activity. A hill so close to the city, yet nestled so
                         near the protective arms of the sea.

            </h1>
            <p class="lead  fs-6 fw-normal">
                Located 16 km away from the state capital Thiruvananthapuram (Kerala), 
                Kovalam is awesomely beautiful and a haven of serenity. It's a pleasant
                 tourist spot in 'God's Own Country'. It's a magnificent beach supported 
                 by sharply mounting headlands and enclosed by fertile coconut palms.
                  Placed snugly in the southern part of Kerala, Kovalam has created its
                   presence fingered on the worldwide tourist map, due to its clean and 
                   bizarre beaches lined with glittering sand and tall light houses. The
                    privy coves, sun kissed beaches, and the coastal towns of Kovalam 
                    enliven with its freshening up nature and the pristine atmosphere. 
                    It's divided into two main beaches namely the Eve's beach and the
                     Lighthouse beach. It offers the best facilities to its beach lovers
                      like swimming, Ayurvedic massages, sunbathing, and many other options.

                Varkala
              </h1>
              <p class="lead  fs-6 fw-normal">
                Varkala, a calm and quiet hamlet, lies on the outskirts of Thiruvananthapuram 
                district. It has several tourist attractions that include a beautiful beach,
                 a 2000-year-old Vishnu Temple and the Ashramam - Sivagiri Mutt a little distance 
                 from the beach. The Papanasam Beach (also called as Varkala Beach), 
                 which is ten kilometers away from Varkala, is renowned for a natural spring.
                  Which is considered to have medicinal and curative properties. A dip 
                  in the holy waters at this beach is believed to purge the body of 
                  impurities and the soul of all sins; hence the name 'Papanasam Beach'.
                   A two thousand-year-old shrine the Janardhanaswamy Temple stands on the 
                   cliffs overlooking the beach, a short distance away. The Sivagiri Mutt, 
                   founded by the great religious reformer and philosopher Sree Narayana Guru
                    (1856 - 1928) is also close by. The Samadhi (the final resting place)
                     of the Guru here attracts thousands of devotees every year during 
                     the Sivagiri Pilgrimage days - 30th December to 1st January. Sree 
                     Narayana Guru propagated the ideology: "one caste, one religion and
                      one God", in a society torn by the taboos of caste system.
