            <p class="lead fs-6 fw-normal">Thrissur , formerly Trichur, also known by its historical
                 name Thrissivaperur, is a city and the headquarters of the Thrissur district
                  in Kerala, India. It is the third largest urban agglomeration in Kerala after
                   Kochi and Kozhikode, and the 21st largest in India. The city is built 
                   around a 65-acre (26 ha) hillock called the Thekkinkaadu Maidaanam which 
                   seats a large Hindu Shiva Temple. It is located central of the state, 
                   and 304 kilometres (189 mi) north-west of the state's capital city, 
                   Thiruvananthapuram. Thrissur was once the capital of the Kingdom of 
                   Cochin, and was a point of contact for the Assyrians, Greeks, Persians,
                    Arabs, Romans, Portuguese, Dutch and English. <br>

                Thrissur is also known as the Cultural Capital of Kerala because
                 of its cultural, spiritual and religious leanings throughout history.
                  The city centre contains the Kerala Sangeetha Nadaka Academy, Kerala
                   Lalithakala Akademi and Kerala Sahitya Academy. The city hosts the 
                   Thrissur Pooram festival, the most colourful and spectacular temple
                    festival in Kerala. The festival is held at the Thekkinkadu Maidan
                     in April or May, in the Malayalam month 'medam'. <br>
                
                Religion is important and varied in Thrissur. The city has historically been a
                 centre of Hindu scholarship, and Christianity, Islam and Judaism are believed
                  to have entered the Indian subcontinent through Thrissur and its surrounding areas.

            <p class="lead  fs-6 fw-normal">
                Officially known as the cultural capital of Kerala,
                 Thrissur is famous for fostering classical Keralan performing arts,
                  religious sites and the renowned Thrissur Pooram festival, Onam 
                  festival and Vadakkumnathan Temple. Thrissur is the short form 
                  of Thiru-Shiva-Per-Ur which literally means “a city with three
                   temples of Lord Shiva”. Thrissur later became anglicised to Trichur.  <br>

               Thrissur is from where Kerala gets a fair share of its festive glitter.
                Thrissur was the capital of the Kingdom of Kochi. The festivals celebrated
                 here are the major attraction for tourists and a visit to Thrissur is 
                 incomplete without witnessing these. Other tourist spots in Thrissur 
                 include the Vadakkumnathan Kshetram Temple, Tomb of Shakthan Thampuran,
                  Archaeology Museum, Athirapally Falls, Heritage Garden and many more.

                River in Thrissur district of Kerala. One of the famous tourist attractions. <br>
                
                in Kerala, the magnificent waterfalls are a sight worth witnessing. This
                 is the biggest waterfall in Kerala. Athirapally falls comes down from 
                 a height of 80 feet through several parallel streams. In the monsoon 
                 season, in its full might, the waterfalls appear like Niagara Falls.

                    Rainbows are also a common sight. It usually takes 2-3 hours to explore
                     the waterfalls. <br>
                
                The surrounding environs of the waterfalls is a bio diversity hotspot. The river
                 is blessed with 85 species of fresh water fish living in it. The forest is

                Vadakkunnathan Temple
            </h1>
            <p class="lead  fs-6 fw-normal">
                Vadakkunnathan Temple, or Vadakkumnathan Temple, in Thrissur is one of the most
                 popular temples in Kerala. It is believed to be the first Shiva temple built 
                 by Lord Parasurama who is the sixth incarnation of Lord Vishnu. This temple 
                 is however one of the UNESCO recognised heritage sites. The temple is also
                  known as Thenkailasam or Vrishabhachalam.The temple is built in typical 
                  Kerala style architecture, located on a hillock in the heart of Thrissur 
                  city. Standing tall in the centre of 9 acres of land, the temple doesn't
                   fail to grab attention of the passers-by. There are 4 gateways called 
                   gopurams to the temple facing East, West, North and South respectively. <br>

                The temple is known for the rare murals portrayed here that include scenes 
                from Mahabharatha, of which Vasukishayana and Nrithanatha are worshipped
                 daily. Apart from these murals, the temple also houses a museum that
                  showcases ancient paintings, woodcarving and other works of art of 
                  ancient times.The Koothambalam of the temple, or the temple theatre,
                   is rich in its display of wooden carved vignettes. Koothambalam is
                    used for staging ritualistic art forms of Central Kerala like Koothu,
                     Koodiyattam and Nangyar Koothu. The three main shrines in this temple 
                     are of Sri Vadakkunnathan (Lord Shiva), Lord Shankaranarayana and Lord 
                     Rama. Goddess Parvati is also worshipped here. One for the strange aspects 
                     of the temple is that the ghee offered here for centuries doesn't melt,
                      even in scorching summers. It is also believed that if the ghee covering 
                      the linga melts, that would lead to a massive disaster.

              </h1>
              <p class="lead  fs-6 fw-normal">

                in Guruvayur town of Thrissur district, Guruvayur Temple is easily accessible

                  from Guruvayoor. Thrissur comprises the nearest railway station at a run 
                  of 29 kms from the temple. Guruvayur Temple is supposed to have been
                   5,000 years old. In those times, it was known as "Bhooloka Vaikunta"
                   
                   (Abode of God on Earth). The term 'Guruvayur' is said to have been derived
                    from two words, 'Guru' (preceptor of the gods) and 'Vayu' (god of winds). 
                    The temple is dedicated to Lord Krishna, who is also known by the name 
                    of Guruvayoorappan. Due to its reverence, Guruvayur Temple is also known as
                    'Dakshina Dwaraka' (Southern Dwarka). <br>

                The presiding deity is Lord Krishna is the form of Maha Vishnu (Lord Krishna
                 is an incarnation of Lord Vishnu). The image is depicted in a standing posture, 
                 which has four hands holding Shankh (conch), Sudarshana Chakra (a serrated disk),
                  Lotus and Mace. The image is worshipped as Balakrishna, an incarnation of Lord 
                  Vishnu. It is carved out of a rare stone named Patala Anjana. The walls of the 
                  main shrine are festooned with beautiful mural paintings and intricate carvings.
